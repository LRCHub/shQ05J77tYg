Don't ask me why
I'm running out of laughter
There's tears in these
Not happy ever after
And I thought it was plain to see and I thought
The whole world could be and I thought
We'll be happy ever after

If you say that
I'm living in a pipe dream
It's just looking back
Things are never what they seem
And I hope
I can safely say and i hope
Most thkngs come my way
And I hope
I'll be happy ever after

Down in southern Africa
No happy ever after
Not now but soon forever
While they're sitting comfortably
In that white winter city
How can
We be happy ever after

So don't ask me why
I'm running out of laughter
There's tears in these eyes
Not happy ever after
And I thought it was plain to see and I thought
That maybe you and me
And I thought
We'd be happy ever after
